    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
        being could possess, </b>  and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a
        fireman could be considered a superhero. <br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular
        police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is
        fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being
        couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

        <h2>Batman</h2>

        <p>Believing criminals to be a "cowardly and superstitious lot", Bruce decided that he needed an identity that would strike terror into the hearts of criminals. While considering this, a bat flew into his study, which Bruce took as an omen and inspired him to have his new identity be a bat. To this end, he hired (without revealing his identity) the finest suitmakers to create the bat costume and paid them to tell no one about it.</p>
